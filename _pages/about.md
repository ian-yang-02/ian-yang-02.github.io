Hello! I am an Information Science PhD student at the University of Washington. My advisor is [Aylin Caliskan](https://faculty.washington.edu/aylin/). My research is also supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

Broadly, I'm interested in <strong>socially-aware natural language processing</strong>. I hope to understand the sociocultural implications of language technologies and how to minimize non-normative behaviors in intelligent agents.

I completed my undergraduate degree in computer science at Georgia Tech, where I was advised by [Mark Riedl](http://eilab.gatech.edu/mark-riedl.html). I have also been incredibly fortunate to work with [Norman Sadeh](https://www.normsadeh.org/) at Carnegie Mellon University, [Mingyi Hong](https://people.ece.umn.edu/~mhong/mingyi.html) and [Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/) at the University of Minnesota, and [Dong Xuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=11NcM2EAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) at The Ohio State University.
