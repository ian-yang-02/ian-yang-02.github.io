Hello! I am an incoming Information Science PhD student at the University of Washington, where my research will be supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Broadly, I'm interested in <strong>socially-aware natural language processing</strong>. I hope to understand the sociocultural implications of language technologies and how to minimize non-normative behaviors in intelligent agents.

I completed my undergraduate degree in computer science at Georgia Tech, where I was advised by [Mark Riedl](http://eilab.gatech.edu/mark-riedl.html). I have also been incredibly fortunate to work with [Norman Sadeh](https://www.normsadeh.org/) at Carnegie Mellon University, [Mingyi Hong](https://people.ece.umn.edu/~mhong/mingyi.html) and [Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/) at the University of Minnesota, and [Dong Xuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=11NcM2EAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) at The Ohio State University.

<!-- I recently completed my undergraduate degree in computer science at Georgia Tech. I also dabble in mathematics, philosophy, and linguistics.

Broadly, I'm interested in <strong>socially-aware natural language processing</strong>. I hope to understand the sociocultural implications of language technologies and how to minimize non-normative behaviors in intelligent agents.

My current research at Georgia Tech is in NLP techniques applied to the [value alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment) problem, advised by [Mark Riedl](http://eilab.gatech.edu/mark-riedl.html).

I'm also a research assistant at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Norman Sadeh](https://www.normsadeh.org/). At CMU I'm interested in NLP applied to data security and [privacy](https://usableprivacy.org/).

Most recently, I have been collaborating with [Mingyi Hong](https://people.ece.umn.edu/~mhong/mingyi.html) and [Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/) at the University of Minnesota. At UMN I am working on interpretability reward shaping for RLHF alignment tasks.

Previously, I was a research assistant at The Ohio State University (advised by [Dong Xuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=11NcM2EAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)) where I worked on automatic speech recognition (ASR), and a Full-Stack Software Engineering Intern at [FlightBridge](https://flightbridge.com/). -->
