<h3><b>Background</b></h3>

<p>Beginning in September 2025, I’ll be joining the University of Washington (UW) iSchool as a PhD student in Information Science, where my research will also be supported by the NSF GRFP.</p>

<p>It took me two cycles to get to this point, and across the past couple of years and submitting 44 (!!) applications, I’ve developed some thoughts and opinions about applying for graduate schools (specifically PhD programs in Computer Science, and even more specifically in natural language processing [NLP]).</p>

<p>These thoughts are likely heavily skewed towards US-based CS/NLP programs, so if you are outside of these domains (or even if you are looking to study NLP), please don’t take a dogmatic stance towards any of this.</p>

<p>Some general things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I’m a US Citizen and applied from the US</li>
  <li>I went to a “top” undergraduate school for CS</li>
  <li>I had opportunities to work on research since my freshman year of undergrad</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>PhD Applications</b></h3>

<p>Across two cycles of PhD applications I applied to 44 different programs - 19 for 2023-2024, and 25 for 2024-2025. Interestingly, the only InfoSci program I applied to was the UW iSchool; the rest were pure Computer Science programs or at least housed in the CS schools/departments (this is mostly relevant for CMU, where there are seven separate PhD programs within the SCS).</p>

<p><b><u>Choosing Where to Apply</u></b></p>

<p>Typically, when you are deciding to apply for PhD programs, you should have somewhat of an idea of what you want to study. You don’t necessarily need to have an outlined research plan, but you should be able to have a discussion about why you’re interested in pursuing a PhD in that specific topic. In my case, I knew I wanted to study the societal underpinnings of language technologies, and how to both evaluate existing models and improve their sociocultural alignment in the future.</p>

<p>Because I had a relatively concrete idea of what I wanted to pursue during my PhD (at least for the beginning), I took a good amount of time to research what faculty at which schools were working on similar topics. This ranged from looking up what I was interested in on Google Scholar and seeing what popped up (“LLM Alignment”, “Sociocultural NLP”, and so forth) to browsing through conference proceedings at well known NLP (EMNLP, NAACL, etc.), ML (ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS), and AI Ethics (FAccT, AIES) conferences to see who was doing work that I was interested in. This meant that I was compiling a list of <u>professors</u> rather than <u>schools</u>, and I decided which progams to apply to based on which potential advisors I thought were interesting.</p>

<p>If you are already working with a professor on similar research to what you want to pursue during your PhD, then they can also be an invaluable resource for finding other faculty working on common topics.</p>

<p>It so happens that typically the “top” schools have the most faculty, which in turn means that they are more likely to have people working on what you’re interested in. I found this to be the case - according to most sources, I ended up applying to schools that were ranked in the top 50, with most in the top 20 or so in the US.</p>

<p>I considered applying to a couple of places outside of the US, but ultimately decided not to for a couple of reasons. One of these was simply that it was outside of my comfort zone, which is a completely valid reason not to apply/go somewhere when you’ll be spending a significant amount of time (likely 5-7 years) there.</p>

<p><b><u>The Statement of Purpose</u></b></p>

<!-- [My Statement](href="/assets/pdf/") -->

<p><a href="/assets/pdf/SOP_UW_pub.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My Old Statement (2023-2024)</a></p>

<p><a href="/assets/pdf/Statement_of_Purpose_UW_pub.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My New Statement (2024-2025)</a></p>

<p>In my opinion, the SOP is the most important aspect of your application that you have total control over. In fact, it’s one of the only parts of your application that you have complete control over.</p>

<p>To be completely candid (and perhaps to toot my own horn a bit), I’m a fairly strong writer. At the very least, I wasn’t intimidated by the SOP, and actually enjoyed writing it quite a lot. That being said, it’s likely a style of writing that’s relatively unfamiliar, and it takes some time for everyone to get it right. For the 2023-2024 cycle, I spent around three months writing and tweaking my statement; for 2024-2025, even though I had my statement from the previous cycle, as well as my GRFP materials, it still took me a couple of months to get it to a point where I was happy.</p>

<p>Other people have written ad nauseam about how to write the SOP, and honestly I don’t think I have any wisdom to share that hasn’t already been fleshed out by someone else. Like many before me, I heavily consulted <a href="https://cs-sop.notion.site/CS-PhD-Statements-of-Purpose-df39955313834889b7ac5411c37b958d">these statements</a> for stylistic choices.</p>

<p><b><u>The Personal Statement (or Diversity Statement)</u></b></p>

<p>I think in many cases the Personal/Diversity Statement is more intimidating than the Statement of Purpose. Not all schools require this statement, but if they do, it’s a good opportunity for you to demonstrate that you’re more than your research. A lot of people approach this statement as a way to demonstrate overcoming personal hardship, setbacks, etc. If you did face challenges in your academic career, then this is absolutely a place for you to discuss those barriers.</p>

<p>I didn’t experience much hardship in my academic journey, to be frank. I spent a lot of time thinking about what I would write about, and I read through a lot of information online discussing how to approach this statement. What I garnered ultimately is that this is a statement about <i>how your personal background will contribute environmentally to your field</i>. Not like trees environmentally, but rather how you can make your space in academia more inclusive, understanding, and open. This involves your contributions to the field, volunteering, mentorship, teaching, etc.</p>

<p>The iSchool at UW actually splits this statement into two separate ones. Honestly I don’t remember what the exact prompts were, but I’m including both of my statements here for reference.</p>

<p><b><u>The CV</u></b></p>

<p>Honestly not much to say here. Here’s the one I submitted to schools for reference:</p>

<p><b><u>Interviews</u></b></p>

<p>Conventional wisdom online has previously said that for CS PhD programs, interviews are not always necessary. I think this is no longer true in the majority of cases (there are exceptions). There are way too many applicants now. In a position where 10 people could fill one spot, interviews are probably necessary to distinguish between them beyond what’s on paper.</p>

<p>I interviewed with four programs in 2023-2024, and nine programs in 2024-2025. I wore a black mock neck shirt in all of them (no need to dress up). Most of these interviews were just conversations about research and interests, and trying to gauge whether there was a good fit with the lab. In one interview I had to prepare some slides to discuss both my previous research, and a prior publication from the professor. In another I was asked a couple of interesting theoretical questions to judge my mathematical reasoning and a bit of knowledge about the field. The vast majority though were simply discussing what research we found interesting, and looking for overlaps in potential new projects.</p>

<p>Oftentimes, the professor will tell you what to expect from the interview beforehand. It’s easy to say and hard to do, but try not to stress too much. In my first cycle, I was extremely nervous for all of my interviews. This past cycle, I eased up a lot and treated each one more as a friendly chat/discussion, and I think they went a lot better.</p>

<p>Here is the schedule of my interviews (some programs I interviewed more than once [often with different professors from the department], which accounts for the disparity in numbers from the above programs):</p>

<p>2023-2024:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1x January 12, 2024</li>
  <li>1x January 26, 2024</li>
  <li>1x January 30, 2024</li>
  <li>1x January 31, 2024</li>
  <li>1x February 16, 2024</li>
  <li>1x February 21, 2024</li>
</ul>

<p>2024-2025:</p>
<ul>
  <li>3x January 7, 2025</li>
  <li>1x January 9, 2025</li>
  <li>2x January 24, 2025</li>
  <li>1x January 30-31, 2025 (virtual visit style)</li>
  <li>1x February 6, 2025</li>
  <li>1x February 7, 2025</li>
  <li>1x February 10, 2025</li>
  <li>2x February 11, 2025</li>
  <li>1x February 12, 2025</li>
  <li>1x February 20, 2025</li>
  <li>1x February 26, 2025</li>
</ul>

<p>This year (2025), I also declined an interview on April 17th, as I had already accepted the offer at UW.</p>

<p>I didn’t receive a waitlist/offer from any program that I did not interview with.</p>
